# College-Admission-using-R
**Background and Objective:**  Every year thousands of applications are being submitted by international students for admission in colleges of the USA. It becomes an iterative task for the Education Department to know the total number of applications received and then compare that data with the total number of applications successfully accepted and visas processed. Hence to make the entire process easy, the education department in the US analyze the factors that influence the admission of a student into colleges. The objective of this exercise is to analyse the same. Performed different models like Logistic Regression, KNN and Decision tree to find the accurate model for this project.  
**Domain:** Education
**Analysis Tasks:** 
Analyze the historical data and determine the key drivers for admission.
**Predictive:** 
**->** Find the missing values. (if any, perform missing value treatment)
Find outliers (if any, then perform outlier treatment)
Find the structure of the data set and if required, transform the numeric data type to factor and vice-versa.
Find whether the data is normally distributed or not. Use the plot to determine the same. 
Normalize the data if not normally distributed.
Use variable reduction techniques to identify significant variables.
Run logistic model to determine the factors that influence the admission process of a student (Drop insignificant variables) 
Calculate the accuracy of the model and run validation techniques.
Try other modelling techniques like decision tree and SVM and select a champion model 
Determine the accuracy rates for each kind of model 
Select the most accurate model 
Identify other Machine learning or statistical techniques
